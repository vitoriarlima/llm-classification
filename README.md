# Language and Text Classification Projects

This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks focused on various text classification tasks, including:

1. **Language Classification**: Detects the language of given text inputs using a machine learning model.
2. **Fake News Classification**: Classifies news articles as real or fake based on their content.
3. **YouTube Comments Classification**: Identifies spam comments in YouTube datasets.
4. **Email Spam/Phishing Classification**: Classifies emails as safe or phishing based on their content.

Each notebook demonstrates the use of different machine learning techniques and libraries, such as `pandas`, `instructor`, `pydantic`, and `OpenAI`, to build and evaluate classification models.

For a more in-depth understanding of these projects, please refer to the detailed blog post linked below:
